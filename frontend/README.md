# eFinder Frontend Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the eFinder frontend application. The frontend is a venue booking platform built with vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5.

## Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **Web Browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- **Backend API** (must be running on port 3000)

### Backend Dependencies
Before testing the frontend, ensure the backend API is running:
```bash
cd ../backend
npm install
npm start
```
The backend should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

## Starting the Frontend Server

### Method 1: Using the Built-in Server
```bash
cd frontend
node server.js
```
The frontend will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`

### Method 2: Using a Local Web Server
If you prefer using a different server:
```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Using Node.js http-server (install globally first)
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8000
```
